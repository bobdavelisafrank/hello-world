# hello-world

I am a student with an interest in mathematics, computers, and programming. 

Currently, with programming and computers, most of what I know is informally taught and incomplete; and most of what I do goes along with that nature. My actions are mainly dictated by my interest, so programming has been more of a background thing that I pick up once a month.

I haven't done much major yet, and I may not even work on anything major at all; but I hope to learn most everything I can.
